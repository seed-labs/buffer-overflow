Thanks for checking out the SEED Labs projects! We're excited to hear and learn from you. Your experiences will benefit the cybersecurity education around the world. 
We've put together the following guidelines to help you figure out where you can best be helpful.

## Types of Contributions We're Looking For

- **Improvement**. Improve the existing SEED labs. One of the improvement we want is to transition some of the SEED labs from the multi-VM lab environment to VM + multi-container
environment. This is the future direction for the SEED labs. 

- **New labs**. Developing new SEED labs in the areas that are not covered by the current SEED labs, such as forensics, reverse engineering, intrusion detection, Blockchain, AI for security, etc. We will set up guidelines, requirements and quality control for new labs. Each new lab is a new product. 

- **VM Building**. Automate the process to build SEED VMs for various platform, VirtualBox, VMware, Cloud, etc.
 
- **CTFizing SEED labs**. Turning some of the SEED labs into CTF (Capture the Flag) style. We have been experimenting with this idea for a few years, and that is a good direction to pursue. We need to develop a CTF platform for SEED labs.  

- **Simulators**. Developing various simulators that can be used for 
*cybersecurity education*. We have several types of simulators in mind, including Internet Simulator and simulators for IoT networks, vehicle network (CAN bus), Blockchain, smart grid, etc. Each of these simulators will be a standalone project.

- **Translation**. Translating the SEED labs to other languages.

- **Website**. Maintaining the website, designing artwork (e.g. icons) for each lab.

- **Training and support**. Training instructors and provide support to help instructors around the world.  

- **Fund raising**. Raising fund to cover the operation cost.


## How to Contribute

We have several projects in the SEEDLabs organization, each of them is in
a different repository. You can choose to work on these existing projects, or you can create new project (such as a translation project). Here are the existing projects:

- [SEED Labs](https://github.com/seed-labs/seed-labs): This is where the original SEED labs documents are stored. 
You can help improve these labs or propose new labs. We are also developing the 
container version for most of the existing labs. 

- [SEED VMs](https://github.com/seed-labs/seed-labs/tree/master/lab-setup): This is part of the SEED Labs project, 
we would like to automate the process to
build SEED VMs for VirtualBox, VMWare, AWS cloud, Azure cloud, etc. 
 Cyber ranges and cloud operators can use the code to build their the VM images
 for their own environment.  
 
 - [Internet Simulator](under-construction.md): We are building an Internet Simulator
 for Cybersecurity education. In this simulator, we have BGP routing, Autonomous Systems,
 Internet Exchange, DNS, etc, including all the essential pieces of the 
 Internet infrastructure. Basically, we got an Internet inside a box. We have worked
 on this project for one and an half years, most of the time spent on the design. We will soon open source this project when we release the first version. 

 - [SEED-CTF](under-construction.md): We are building a CTF platform, so instructors can easily turn their  class into a CTF competition. We have 
 been experimenting with this for several years. We will soon open source all our code. 

 - **Translation**: We are looking for help to translate the SEED 
   labs to different languages. See the [license information](LICENSE.md)
   related to the translated work. 
   You don't need to commit to translate all the documents. The goal
   is to find a group of people who can do this together, so each person
   only needs to translate one or a few labs. 

   - [Brazilian Portuguese Translation](https://github.com/seed-labs/seedlabs-bp):
     This is the Brazilian Portuguese translation project. 
     Contributors are still needed.
     
   - [Chinese Translation](https://github.com/seed-labs/seedlabs-chinese):
     This is the Chinese translation led by a group of professors in China.
     Contributors are still needed.  

   - [French Translation](https://github.com/seed-labs/seedlabs-french):
     This is the French translation project. 
     Contributors are still needed.
     
   - [Spanish Translation](https://github.com/seed-labs/seedlabs-spanish):
     This is the Spanish translation project. Contributors are still needed.
     
   - Other languages: Help for other languages are needed.

 - **New Project Proposal**: Feel free to propose new projects that fit into the vision of the SEED project.
 Treat this SEEDlabs organization as a big community, where we work together 
 on the same goal: *developing hands-on labs to benefit 
 the cybersecurity education around the world*.


**Get started**: If you are interested in any of these projects, you can start
creating a fork from them, and check the issues in those particular project. They have detailed instructions on what are needed. If you are not sure or you don't know whether a particular task has been taken by others, create an issue in those
repos, and some of us will respond to you.
